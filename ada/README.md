Voice assistant powered by Home Assistant.

Voice assistants are a great way to interact with your house, ask a quick
question, set a timer or control your devices. The more an assistant knows about
you, your home and itâ€™s other inhabitants, the better it is able to help you.

Ada is powered by Almond which is an open, privacy-preserving virtual assistant
that is open source.
